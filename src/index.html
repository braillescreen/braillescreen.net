<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>I am about to re-build this website to look better. Until then, this page exists.<br>
Please keep in mind that a re-build doesn't mean that the content will actually be worth looking at; merely that it will exist in a different way (I.E. Wording, etc.)</p>

<h2>Links of Interest</h2>
