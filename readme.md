The source code to [my website](https://braillescreen.net).

## Building the site
TODO!


That's all there is to it! A very quick static site, that still allows me to write in Markdown and not consider HTML when I just want to write!

Any reports, fixes or improvements are most certainly welcome and appreciated! If you have an idea that would be considered a big change to either the site's functionality or content, please open an issue first. Thanks!
