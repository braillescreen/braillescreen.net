# braillescreen.net

The source code to [my website](https://braillescreen.net).

## Building the site
The website currently uses [Cobalt](https://cobalt-org.github.io). It is configured so that running `cobalt build` should work (assuming it is installed), putting the output in `public_html`.

This website is largely based on the website of [the Nonvisual Gaming Toolkit](https://nvgt.gg) with some stripping of stuff I didn't require as well as other small changes.

That's all there is to it! A very quick static site, that still allows me to write in Markdown and not consider HTML when I just want to write!

Any reports, fixes or improvements are most certainly welcome and appreciated! If you have an idea that would be considered a big change to either the site's functionality or content, please open an issue first. Thanks!
