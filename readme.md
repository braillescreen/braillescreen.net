There was once plans to put a useful website here. However, the useful website has turned into a blog. This is a repo with some old HTML I wrote a very long time ago. It was a silly solution then, but I wanted a thing to exist and that's what ended up happening.

I don't actively plan on updating it, but I'm me. I'll probably do something with it eventually.

I'd tell you when I actually made these files, but I broke all the modified dates. Probably sometime in 2021.

Thanks for visiting!
