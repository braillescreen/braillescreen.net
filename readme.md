# braillescreen.net

The source code to my Hugo website.

The current code here is only used for staging until considered production-ready; you can [view a built version of this staging site](https://staging.braillescreen.net) or build it with simply:
```
git clone https://github.com/braillescreen/braillescreen.net.git
cd braillescreen.net
hugo
```

That's all there is to it! A very quick static site, that still allows me to write in Markdown and not consider HTML when I just want to write!


Please feel free to report / fix issues and whatnot if you find a typo etc.
