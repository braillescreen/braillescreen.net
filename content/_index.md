# Welcome!
I would like to welcome you to my website! I hope you have a good time!

This is a staging site and will eventually replace [my main one](https://braillescreen.net/). However, this is being fixed live before your eyes to not be as annoying, hopefully something you can read etc. It will even be [open-source](https://github.com/braillescreen/braillescreen.net) on GitHub.

The reason this site exists as it does now is so that in the future I don't have to do much work - merely write a page and it maintains the default templates and whatnot. Oh and better visual appeal (one can dream, at least).
