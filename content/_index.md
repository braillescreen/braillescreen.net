# Welcome!
I would like to welcome you to my website!

This is a staging site and will eventually replace [my main one](https://braillescreen.net/). However, this is being fixed live before your eyes to not be as annoying, hopefully something you can read etc. It will even be [open-source](https://github.com/braillescreen/braillescreen.net).

The reason this site exists as it does now is so that in the future I don't have to do much work - merely write a page and it maintains the default templates and whatnot. Oh and better visual appeal (one can dream, at least).

## About me
I'm a:
 * Blind server administrator (Linux; Debian-based usually) who enjoys doing IoT, Docker hosting of stuff etc.,
 * Programmer (Python and other basic scripting languages when brain power allows),
 * Musician (piano and drums),
 and much more!

Please feel free to navigate around this site to check out stuff that's available. If you have any feedback feel free to submit an issue, PR, etc.
