<h1>BrailleScreen's Website</h1>
<p>While this page isn't much in the grand scheme of things, it is my own nevertheless. This page is merely a page that gives people access to the stuff I do. Nothing more -- perhaps I will bother sometime.<br>
I'm Patrick Wilson; a totally blind technologist involving myself among a fair bit of trades. I enjoy server administration most, followed by accessibility testing and such. I also enjoy music and audio production.</p>

<p>While this is certainly not the most interesting website (especially home page) I do hope you enjoyed the content! Additionally, I may add more stuff or randomly redesign it again in the future.</p>
